	* processing.c: Further libcurl Conditioning; Added HAVE_LIBCURL
	macro after HAVE_CURL_CURL_H to ensure libcurl library is
	present along with curl/curl.h header. This is especially needed
	for building on Win32 systems with MinGW as the current
	construct of configure.ac only checks for the dynamically linked
	(shared) version of libcurl.

	* processing.c: Repaired Defect in Remote File Processing;
	Because curlCallback() returned size of post-processed content,
	libcurl was not able to properly iterate through the content,
	thus only returning the first batch of retrieved content, which
	was why remote files appeared to have produced very little
	results, if any. By having curlCallback() returned the
	pre-processed size (realsize), it was able to accurately
	iternate, retrieving the content in its entirety.

	* temurah.c: Excess newline removal; Removed the extra newline
	character whenever receiving word or phrase from stdin.

	* processing.c: More memory optimization; because
	stripNonAlpha() and stripMarkupTags() return malloc'd addresses,
	it's best to have pointers other than fb->fbuffer to handle
	their processed text streams, then strncpy'd the finished
	product to a freshly malloc'd fb->fbuffer. This helps to free
	(nearly) all malloc'd memory when the programs are about to end.

	* processing.c: Proper memory optimization; pointers returned by
	stripNonAlpha() and stripMarkupTags() have malloc'd addresses
	that were not being freed properly.

	* processing.c: stripMarkupTags() modified to explicitly exclude
	not only <script> tags but all content preceding </script>.

	* processing.c: generateLists(): Optimized collection and
	sorting; phrases are only collected and sorted if "ltype" is
	explicitly set to "phraselist". This will ensure faster result
	searches for words only.

2012-11-08	Marc Sylvestre	<marc.sylvestre@manhydra.com>

	* processing.c: Added libcurl to allow for searching results on
	remote files, web pages, etc.

	Created stripMarkupTags() to strips markup language tags (e.g.
	<body>, <div>, etc.) from hypertext documents.

	* processing.c: When processing web pages with elaborate XHTML
	markup design, an unexpected result causes malloc() in
	stripNonAlpha() and stripMarkupTags() to fail:

	malloc.c:3097: sYSMALLOc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr)
	(((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof
	(struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned
	long) (old_size) >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof
	(struct malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) -
	1)) & ~((2 * (sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1)
	&& ((unsigned long)old_end & pagemask) == 0)' failed.

	Using realloc() instead alleviates this.
