English Kabbalah is a collection of command-line applications that 
perform various coding/ciphering tasks, along with searching a given 
file for the results thereof.

- English Gematria
  Outputs a gematria value for an inputted word or phrase.
  Outputs a lists of words or phrases from a given file, where
  the gematria value of each word or phrase is equal to that of the
  inputted word or phrase.

- English Temurah
  Ciphers an inputted word or phrase using four key methods:
  
  + Avgad: Replaces each letter with the one that comes after it 
	(forward shift) or before it (backward shift) in the English
	Alphabet.
  
  + Atbash: Replaces the first letter of the English alphabet with the 
    last letter, the second with the next-to-last, and so on.
  
  + Albam: Replaces the first letter of the English alphabet with the 
    twelfth, the second with the thirteenth, and so on.

  Outputs the number of times an enciphered inputted word or phrase 
  is found within a given file for each method used.

  letters are replaced with those in their respective group and class.

Subject Background
==================

Kabbalah is often defined as an esoteric discipline or school of 
philosophy. Various descriptions exist, however, one of the most 
overlooked aspects or practices in Kabbalah (and probably the most 
fundamental) is an area known as the "Literal Kabbalah."

This area is often described as having concerns with the 
relationship between letters and numbers, however, this is a very 
general description of what in actually is a sophisticated 
coding/ciphering system. All the methods of the Literal Kabbalah 
were used in various coding/ciphering activities, most notably in 
military intelligence, and espionage.
