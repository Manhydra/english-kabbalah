A non-profit organization in the United States that seeks to stop 
drunk driving, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, support those affected 
by drunk driving, prevent underage drinking, and overall push for 
stricter alcohol policy. These aren't mothers against deep dreaming or 
mothers against dumpster diving. It's most certainly not dumb drunks against 
mental mothers, although some may argue against that. So, in short, Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving is committed to getting drunks off the street, 
or as least out of their cars.
